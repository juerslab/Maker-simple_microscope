# Notes for development of the microscope framework
9/24/2024
The framework is made of 4 pieces of laser cut 1/8" acrylic sheet, with a fifth piece used as a platform to hold the sample. The platform height can be adjusted finely on one side, and has two positions possible for the other side.   

Because the acrylic can be slippery, the rubber band used to hold the camera/objective adapter on the objective was also used to hold the framework together. Since I am obviating the need to hold the camera/objective adapter on the objective by threading the adapter, it would be nice if the framework held together in a different way.

If the framework is built out of plywood, it stays together pretty well without the rubber band. So I will be switching to plywood.


### Build aspects 
- plywood
- added numerical guides to aid in assembling framework
- added some other text on the framework
- increased height of window for adjusting hex bolt to make it easier for fingers to fit
- need to move out the hex nut hole just a bit
