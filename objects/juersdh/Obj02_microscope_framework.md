# Notes for development of the microscope framework
9/24/2024
The framework is made of 4 pieces of laser cut 1/8" acrylic sheet, with a fifth piece used as a platform to hold the sample. The platform height can be adjusted finely on one side, and has two positions possible for the other side.   

Because the acrylic can be slippery, the rubber band used to hold the camera/objective adapter on the objective was also used to hold the framework together. Since I am obviating the need to hold the camera/objective adapter on the objective by threading the adapter, it would be nice if the framework held together in a different way.

If the framework is built out of plywood, it stays together pretty well without the rubber band. So I will be switching to plywood.


### Build aspects 
- plywood
- added numerical guides to aid in assembling framework
- added some other text on the framework
- increased height of window for adjusting hex bolt to make it easier for fingers to fit
- need to move out the hex nut hole just a bit

I did these things, and made a couple frameworks out of 1/8" plywood. However, a new(ish) problem appears, which is that the field of view oscillates. So I investigate these oscillations

### Oscillations

The amplitude appears to be perpendicular to the ~mirror plane of the framework. It's larger with the newer camera. When I tap the table, the oscillations are in this direction. The seem to be worse with the wooden framework than the acrylic framework. If I add a rubber band around the framework they are a bit smaller. So it could be:
- the framework is less stiff in this direction
- the objective/camera combo swings in this direction


The wooden frame appears to be less stiff than the acrylic frame, when flexing in my hand.

#### Attempts to reduce the oscillations
- Putting the wooden frame on a piece of open cell foam improved things a lot.
- The amplitude also depends on the surface. On one table the oscillations are larger than on another table.

Tried using thicker stock - 3/16" acrylic. This worked quite well. So will switch to thicker. 3/16" isn't readily available online, but 1/4" is, so will check that.
- Tried with 1/4" acrylic. But this seems less forgiving to bending, and will probably fracture after fewer cycles of assembly/disassembly.

Also switch to fine thread bolts
